#MultiTransfer

This project is largely based off the concept of style transfer, A technique developed by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S.
Ecker, and Matthias Bethge. The idea behind this project was to attempt to produce unique art. If one single style is
copied this is just replication. If multiple styles are used now the computer has to make some decisions as to how to
replicate each style. These decisions at the end of computation end up producing an image that is the best possible fit
to all the styles referenced. At times this can produce a unique mesh of all styles and at other times it appears as a
patchwork of styles coming together.
